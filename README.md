# DiscordNitroSniper
Fast multi-threaded discord nitro sniper written in C# with dotnet 6 (as fast as GO or even faster at requests) using proxies from proxy scrape's API. Auto activates code on account after found. Rewrite of my old [Discord-Nitro-Sniper Repo](https://github.com/Obscurely/Discord-Nitro-Sniper/), old one was old and bad quite bad written since I was at start with API's client requests and c# in general.

## General Info
Discord nitro sniper. 

## Why C# and not GO for Mass Http Requesting
Written in C# instead of GO like people usually do for mass http requesting because from my testing dotnet 6 compared to latest GO version, by making a lot of requests, C# even proved faster than GO with 1ms on average, that's insignificant, but the point is it doesn't matter so I chose to go with C# since I like it more and is more optimized IMO for multi threading.
